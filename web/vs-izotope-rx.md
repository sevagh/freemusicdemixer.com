# Music Demixer vs. iZotope RX: Which stem separation tool is right for you?

**Music Demixer** (aka [freemusicdemixer.com](https://freemusicdemixer.com)) uses cutting-edge **Demucs** AI to separate music into stems — all inside your web browser. Meanwhile, **iZotope RX** is a premium audio repair suite with stem separation capabilities tucked within its broader toolkit. Although RX is trusted by audio professionals, read on to learn why Music Demixer may be a more affordable, streamlined choice for pure stem separation.

## Quick facts about iZotope RX
- **Pricey licensing**: Top iZotope RX editions can exceed \$1,000 for a single license, or require subscription fees.
- **Desktop-limited**: RX is available on Windows and macOS only, with no official Linux or Chromebook support.
- **Designed for broad audio repair**: While powerful for noise reduction and restoration, iZotope’s stem separation sometimes plays second fiddle to its main editing features.

In contrast, **Music Demixer** focuses exclusively on advanced AI-based stem separation, delivering clarity without the bloat—or the budget burn.

## What sets Music Demixer apart

### 1. State-of-the-art Demucs technology
We use the **Demucs** model, a highly regarded AI approach backed by cutting-edge research from Meta, Spotify, and leading open-source communities. By specializing in separation, Demucs is exceptionally good at isolating vocals, instruments, drums, bass, and more—even when frequencies overlap. iZotope RX9 was once powered by Spleeter, an older AI model that has since been completely dethroned by Demucs - check out [our comparison with Spleeter here](/vs-spleeter). The newer versions might have upgraded, but the fact is you're paying thousands of dollars to a **private corporation that is not transparent about the academic AI models and technology they use.**

### 2. Web-based simplicity
- **No installation required**: Music Demixer runs entirely in your web browser. No bulky downloads, no OS constraints — just upload (locally or in-browser), separate, and go.
- **Works on any platform**: Whether you’re on Windows, macOS, Linux, or a Chromebook, you can demix your audio so long as you have a modern browser.

### 3. Affordable pricing
- **Free tier**: Start with a free plan to test out the quality of Demucs.
- **PRO plan**: Upgrade to unlimited usage and additional features for \$50 CAD per year — dramatically lower than iZotope RX’s price points.

### 4. Local in-browser processing
**Your files never leave your device.** Unlike many “cloud” solutions, Music Demixer uses WebAssembly to process everything locally, ensuring total privacy and no hidden server queues.

### 5. Real user feedback
We can’t provide a formal A/B test with iZotope RX audio clips due to licensing costs. However, we receive genuine testimonials from our customers:

> “**The demixing was very good, and much better than I was getting with RX 10.**”

If you’re primarily looking for high-fidelity stem separation, why pay extra for an entire audio repair suite when Music Demixer can deliver great results at a fraction of the cost?

## Frequently asked questions

### Is Music Demixer only for pros?
Not at all. Our **free tier** is perfect if you’re just experimenting, while the PRO subscription suits regular or advanced users who need unlimited, high-quality separations.

### Do I need a powerful computer?
A modern desktop or laptop helps, but because we use WebAssembly, any reasonably up-to-date machine can handle the separation without the massive overhead of a dedicated app.

### Can I do more than just vocals, bass, drums, and piano?
Yes! Our Demucs-based model can isolate extra instruments (like guitar or other melodic lines). We also offer a built-in **MIDI converter** and **sheet music transcriber** for those who want to remix or transcribe stems.

### How does Music Demixer handle confidentiality?
We never store or upload your audio. All demixing happens right in your browser, so your projects stay private. This is especially helpful for unreleased tracks or sensitive material.

### Do you offer support?
Absolutely. Our team is ready to help with any questions, from basic getting-started tips to more advanced production techniques. We pride ourselves on prompt responses and clear documentation.
