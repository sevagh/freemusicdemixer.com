## New yearly price

Our product is priced at $9.99 CAD per month. For 1 year of demixing, that's $119.88 CAD.

Now, we're introducing a yearly billing option at $49.99 CAD per year. This is a 60% discount compared to the monthly billing if you know you'll be using the tool for a long time! Save $70 today!

## New customers

If you're a new subscriber to our product, simply choose the yearly billing option from the Stripe product page:

If you visit the Stripe product page to sign up for the monthly billing, you also have the option there to switch to yearly billing, along with the savings shown ($70, or 60%!):
