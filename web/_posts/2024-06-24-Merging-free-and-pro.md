## Our Free site

This site (<https://freemusicdemixer.com>) started off by offering unlimited usage of Demucs v4 in the browser.

## Our PRO site

Our former PRO site (<https://pro.freemusicdemixer.com>) contained a paid subscription product which added support for 6 additional higher-quality, specialized AI models including **piano** and **guitar** separation, and **among the best drums and bass separation** available on the market.

The subscription also works on the Android app.

## Today, they are merged

Today, the main free site contains both products - the free-to-use Demucs v4, and the PRO subscription and extra content alongside it. We hope this will streamline our offering and make it easier to provide a unified experience for our customers.

As always, happy demixing!
