Whether you’re a budding musician looking to create sheet music from MP3 files or a seasoned producer who wants to analyze complex chord progressions, our platform’s audio-to-sheet music workflow can help. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the entire process step-by-step, unlocking new creative and educational possibilities for all types of music enthusiasts.

## What is AI music transcription and how does it work?

AI music transcription leverages machine learning algorithms trained on vast datasets of audio. When you feed a recording into a MIDI transcription tool, it identifies pitches, rhythms, and instruments, ultimately producing a digital representation of the notes as a MIDI file. By using AI music transcription, you can transform any audio — be it a professional studio track or a home recording — into a format that’s easy to edit, study, and play along with. Unlike manual transcription, which can take hours of painstaking work, AI-driven tools handle the heavy lifting in a fraction of the time.

## Why convert audio to MIDI?

When you convert audio to MIDI, you’re essentially translating a raw sound wave into a structured, note-by-note blueprint of the music. Here are a few key benefits:
* **Flexible Editing**: MIDI allows you to change instruments, adjust tempos, transpose keys, or even tweak individual notes without degrading sound quality.
* **Audio-to-Sheet Music Made Simple**: Once you have a MIDI file, you can now generate **printable sheet music directly on our platform** (details below!).
* **Better Understanding of Complex Pieces**: By converting a dense mix into separate instrument stems and corresponding MIDI tracks, you can pinpoint intricate melodies, harmonies, and rhythms.
* **Education and Practice**: Teachers and students can study complicated musical passages by viewing them as standard notation, making it easier to learn and practice.

## Step-by-step: from raw audio to printable sheet music

<ol>
<li>Choose your audio file</li>
</ol>

Start by selecting the track you want to transcribe. This could be a popular hit, a classical recording, or even a personal composition. Our platform accepts common audio formats like MP3 or WAV.

<ol start="2">
<li>Isolate instrumental stems (optional but recommended)</li>
</ol>

For the highest quality AI music transcription results, consider using our stem separation feature first. By isolating a particular instrument or vocal line, you’ll get a cleaner, more accurate MIDI output. This especially helps if you want to create sheet music from MP3 recordings that have dense mixes.

<ol start="3">
<li>Run the MIDI transcription tool</li>
</ol>

In your project settings, enable the "Stems + MIDI" option. Our MIDI transcription tool uses advanced algorithms to analyze pitches, timing, and intensity, swiftly producing a MIDI file. The process is largely automated, giving you professional-grade results without the hassle.

<ol start="4">
<li>Download your MIDI and sheet music files</li>
</ol>

Once the transcription process is complete, you can download `.wav` files for the stems, `.mid` files for the MIDI outputs, and **new `.musicxml` files** for printable sheet music. This bridges the gap between raw audio and fully formatted sheet music.

<ol start="5">
<li>View and print sheet music directly in your browser</li>
</ol>

Our new **integrated sheet music viewer** makes it easy to preview and print your score without needing additional software. Simply click the "View and print sheet music" button to open your sheet music in a new tab, powered by [OpenSheetMusicDisplay](https://opensheetmusicdisplay.org/).

<ol start="6">
<li>Refine and edit in notation software (optional)</li>
</ol>

You can also download the `.musicxml` file and import it into your preferred notation software (e.g., MuseScore) for further edits. This allows you to polish phrasing, dynamics, and articulations before saving or printing.

## Tips for getting the best results

<span class="blog-highlight">Start with high-quality audio:</span> Clear, well-balanced recordings are easier for the AI to parse, resulting in more accurate transcription. [Use our highest-quality stem separation settings for the best results](/pricing/#subscribe-today).

<span class="blog-highlight">Focus on a single instrument track at a time:</span> If you’re dealing with complex music, isolate individual instruments before transcription. Fortunately, stem separation is the core feature of our website, leading to a seamless music separation-to-transcription pipeline.

<span class="blog-highlight">Experiment with different tracks:</span> Try transcribing a vocal melody, a piano line, or a guitar solo. Each instrument brings unique insights into composition and arrangement.

<span class="blog-highlight">Manual edits go a long way:</span> Although the transcription will be highly accurate, refining your notation in a sheet music editor ensures the cleanest final result.
