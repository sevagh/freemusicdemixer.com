## Speeding up this site

From my tests on the latest release, demixing a track that used to take 5 minutes now takes 4 minutes.

<span class="blog-highlight">Going forward, our users can expect up to 25% faster demixing times for their tracks!</span>

I am committed to making freemusicdemixer.com run fast and lean. Running faster makes my users happier, while consuming less memory means that even larger tracks can be demixed.

In my personal technical blog, I recently published two posts about my speed optimization work on this site ([1](https://sevag.xyz/blog/bliss/), [2](https://sevag.xyz/blog/speed/)), and I hope to keep optimizing this site and making it lighter and faster every release.
