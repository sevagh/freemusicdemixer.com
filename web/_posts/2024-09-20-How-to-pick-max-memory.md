## Max Memory for our demixer tool

From our demixer tool, when you click on "Advanced", you can change the max memory used:

Every 4 GB of memory increases the number of workers by 1. This means that if you have 16 GB of memory, you can run 4 workers at the same time, which runs the demixing up to **4 times faster.**

However, if you pick too much memory, the tab will crash and you will lose your progress. So, the best thing to do is pick the maximum amount of memory that your computer can handle.

In the demixer app, you should use the highest Max Memory setting that is **less than** your computer's memory. If your Mac has 16 GB of memory, you should select 8 GB in the demixer tool. If your Mac has 32 GB of memory, you should select 16 GB in the demixer tool, and so on.
