## Quick facts about Lalal.ai

[Lalal.ai](https://www.lalal.ai) stands out as one of the few online stem separation services **not** built on older Spleeter technology. It has its own proprietary AI engine, allowing it to achieve better separations than many 2020-era tools. However, it remains a closed-source solution, so details on its architecture and performance metrics are limited.

### Lalal.ai’s comparison to older Demucs (v3)

In its own marketing, Lalal.ai compares favorably to **Demucs v3**. But the Demucs ecosystem has advanced rapidly:

- **Demucs v4** includes architectural improvements and training updates.
- **Ensemble strategies** from the 2023 Sound Demixing Challenge further boost quality in complex scenarios.

**Music Demixer** proudly integrates **Demucs v4** (and beyond) for near state-of-the-art separation without the restrictions of a proprietary “black box” AI.
