# Android app download

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to recent changes to the Google Play Developer policy which would leak the personal information of developers, we refuse to publish our app on the Play Store.

<a href="https://bucket.freemusicdemixer.com/Music-Demixer-app.apk">You can download and install the Music Demixer app directly from this link!</a>

## Is it safe?

The download is a Signed APK, which is perfectly safe. It's a process known as [side loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading), which needs to be enabled in the Android settings for "Install unknown apps":

## Refunds for Play Store customers

As a courtesy, and if this solution doesn't work for you, I am offering refunds for customers who wish to keep using the Play Store. Please send an e-mail to [android@freemusicdemixer.com](mailto:android@freemusicdemixer.com) with your customer details and we will help you out üôè
