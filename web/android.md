# Android app download

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to recent changes to the Google Play Developer policy, where private and personal information of developers will be forced to be displayed in public (which is a dangerous violation of privacy), the Music Demixer app **will be taken off the Play Store** and I will be terminating my developer profile.

**You can download and install the Music Demixer app directly from this link!**

<div class="cta-container-android">
  <a href="https://bucket.freemusicdemixer.com/Music-Demixer-app.apk" class="cta-link-android">
    <span class="cta-arrows-android left">&#9664;&#9664;&#9664;</span>
    Music-Demixer-app.apk
    <span class="cta-arrows-android right">&#9654;&#9654;&#9654;</span>
  </a>
</div>

This is a Signed APK, which is perfectly safe. It's a process known as [side loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading), which needs to be enabled in the Android settings for "Install unknown apps":

In fact, it gives me as the developer more control over shipping you the exact software I wrote without Google acting as an intermediary, ensuring my guarantees of privacy.

## Refunds for Play Store customers

As a courtesy, and if this solution doesn't work for you, I am offering refunds for customers who wish to keep using the Play Store. Please send an e-mail to [android@freemusicdemixer.com](mailto:android@freemusicdemixer.com) with your customer details and we will help you out üôè
