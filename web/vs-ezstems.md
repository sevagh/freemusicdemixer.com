## Introduction to Ezstems.com

[Ezstems.com](https://ezstems.com) has gained some attention for offering 4- and 5-stem separation along with an optional MIDI converter. However, there are some important differences in quality, reliability, cost, and privacy. We believe that Music Demixer, powered by advanced AI research from companies like Meta and Spotify, is a stronger choice for most creators. Below, we’ll explain why.

## Quick overview of Ezstems.com

Spleeter-based core:
* Limited to 4/5 stems
* Relies on the open-source Spleeter library, originally developed by Deezer in 2020. While Spleeter was groundbreaking at launch, it lacks many modern refinements and advanced architectures that newer AI models (like Demucs) bring to the table.

Cloud-based with potential drawbacks
* Uploads to remote servers
* Your audio files are uploaded for processing, which may raise privacy concerns if you’re working on confidential or unreleased tracks.
* Uncertain reliability
* Some users have reported issues where the processing gets stuck indefinitely without clear updates, making it difficult to plan your workflow.

Customer experience reports
* Customer support challenges
* According to some users, customer service responses can be delayed or absent. If your audio processing stalls, there may be no quick fix or reliable guidance from the support team.

## Why Music Demixer outperforms Ezstems.com

1. Advanced, newer AI technology: Demucs vs. Spleeter
* Demucs for clear, artifact-free stems
* Music Demixer leverages Demucs, a state-of-the-art AI model known for superior separation quality. This cutting-edge technology excels at isolating vocals, instruments, bass lines, drums, and more - even when frequencies overlap.
* Our product includes the latest research from Meta & Spotify
* Our team continuously updates Music Demixer with innovations inspired by advanced neural network research from Meta, Spotify, and top AI communities. By contrast, Spleeter has seen fewer major updates in recent years.

3. Privacy & security
* Your files never leave your device
* With Music Demixer, your audio stays on your local machine during processing, eliminating the risk of your work being stored or intercepted on remote servers.
* No waiting in server queues
* Because our system isn’t reliant on a limited cloud instance, you won’t get stuck waiting for your job to finish in a mysterious queue.

4. Robust MIDI conversion
* Latest deep learning approach
* Our MIDI converter is based on cutting-edge research from Spotify’s engineering team, aiming for more accurate note detection and improved timing.
* Practical for remixing & notation
* Whether you want to create a new arrangement, reference chords, or collaborate with other musicians, MIDI files provide invaluable flexibility.

5. Seamless user experience & customer support
* Web-based simplicity
* Music Demixer requires no complex installation or command-line expertise. As long as you have an internet connection and a web browser, you can start demixing within minutes.

## Audio clips

Listen to these audio clips to hear the difference between Spleeter and Demucs for a short clip from *Shimmy Shimmy Ya* by Ol’ Dirty Bastard in 2-stem (vocals/accompaniment or instrumental) separation:
