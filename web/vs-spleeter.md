# Freemusicdemixer vs. Spleeter: Which stem separation tool is best?

## Introduction to Spleeter

Spleeter, [developed by Deezer](https://research.deezer.com/projects/spleeter.html), revolutionized AI stem separation in 2020. As an open-source tool, it paved the way for many online services like <span class="blog-highlight">[Moises](https://moises.ai), [Ezstems.com](https://ezstems.com), and [Vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org)</span>. However, as AI technology has advanced, Spleeter has fallen behind in quality and capabilities, leaving users seeking better alternatives.

Freemusicdemixer.com, powered by the cutting-edge <span class="blog-highlight">Demucs AI model</span>, offers superior stem separation with enhanced clarity, fidelity, and ease of use. Let’s dive into why Freemusicdemixer.com is the best choice for stem separation.

## Spleeter’s limitations

While Spleeter was a game-changer in its time, it now struggles to meet the expectations of modern users. Some key drawbacks include:
* Quality issues: Audio artifacts and imprecise separation make it less suitable for professional use.
* Unflexible stem options: Supports fixed configurations of stems (2, 4, or 5), without support for guitar or 'other melody'.
* Limited quality settings: Only offers a single quality setting, with no customization options.
* Complex setup: Requires technical expertise to install and use, especially for offline applications.
* Websites based on Spleeter: Spleeter-based websites are often unreliable, leading to long wait times and potential downtime. Some are defunct, unable to handle the load of users or the server costs, with customer support offline.

## Freemusicdemixer.com: Powered by Demucs

Freemusicdemixer harnesses the power of Demucs, a state-of-the-art AI model designed for high-quality audio separation. Key advantages include:
* Superior quality: Demucs excels in separating complex audio, handling overlapping frequencies with precision, and minimizing artifacts.
* Broader stem support: Freemusicdemixer supports vocals, bass, drums, piano, melody, and ‘other melody’ (e.g., violin, flute) in arbitrary combinations.
* Even higher quality settings: In ensemble configurations, Demucs can generate much higher qualities than Spleeter, comparable to the best in the world.
* Ease of use: A simple, web-based platform that works on any operating system, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. No complex parameters (frequency cutoff?) or setup required. No flaky backend that may go offline.
* Private and secure: Freemusicdemixer respects user privacy and does not store or share uploaded audio files. All processing is done locally.

Our website uses the latest trained AI models of Demucs that were improved and updated <b>as recently as the 2023 Sound Demixing Challenge</b>, and we are constantly experimenting with improving our algorithms and models.

## Which tools use Spleeter?

Several popular tools and websites rely on Spleeter, inheriting its limitations:
* [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai): Offers a user-friendly interface but [uses Spleeter’s outdated technology](https://musically.com/2019/11/22/moises-makes-deezers-spleeter-audio-separation-tool-user-friendly/).
* [Ezstems.com](https://ezstems.com): A defunct service that provided direct access to Spleeter’s functionality. Users report the service is offline, with unresponsive customer support.
* [Vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org): A free tool based on Spleeter, with a flaky payment system and limited stem options (no piano).
* [Izotope RX8](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/whats-new-in-rx-8.html): [Previously based on Spleeter](https://literecords.com/showthread.php?68357-iZotope-RX-8-Music-Rebalance), though newer versions use unnamed proprietary models.

## Audio clips

Don't just take our word for it. Listen to these audio clips to hear the difference between Spleeter and Demucs for a short clip from Shimmy Shimmy Ya by Ol' Dirty Bastard in 2-stem (vocals/accompaniment or instrumental separation):
<div class="card-container" id="demo-app">

      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_vocal_good.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_instrum_good.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

  </div>

  <div class="card">

      <p>Vocals</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_vocal_bad.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

      </audio>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

You'll immediately notice the difference in clarity and separation between the two. This is only for the simple 2-stem separation, but the difference is even more pronounced with more complex instrument stems:
<div class="card-container" id="demo-app">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h2 class="card-title">Freemusicdemixer.com</h2>
      <p>Piano</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_piano_good.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>Drums</p>

        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_drums_good.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_bass_good.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h2 class="card-title">Spleeter</h2>
      <p>Piano</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_piano_bad.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>Drums</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_drums_bad.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>Bass</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="/assets/clips/spleeter/shimmy_bass_bad.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Notice how unusably muffled the Spleeter stems are compared to the clear and distinct Demucs stems.

## Customer feedback

Users from communities like [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32360816), [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs/issues/267), and [KVRAudio](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=576467) consistently praise Demucs for its superior performance compared to Spleeter. Here’s what they’ve said:
* “After months of testing and hundreds of isolated tracks, I think Demucs is simply the best, in terms of both quality output and fidelity.”
* “I’d pay for a good GUI for Demucs.”
* “Demucs is hands-down better than Spleeter and even Izotope RX9.”

On YouTube, there is a video describing how Demucs is better than Spleeter, with the comments agreeing:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOVqRfoc0aI?si=MqH58_78HyP-VTxP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>

Many of these posts are referring to Demucs v3, which is the older generation of Demucs. <span class="blog-highlight">We support the latest Demucs v4, which offers even better performance and quality</span>, and we develop custom in-house ensemble models and combinations of custom versions of Demucs v4 which compete with or outperform leading stem separation tools today!

## Conclusion

While Spleeter played a pivotal role in the evolution of AI stem separation, it’s no longer the best choice for users seeking top-tier results. Freemusicdemixer, powered by Demucs, offers unmatched quality, broader stem support, and seamless usability.
