# Music Demixer vs. Spleeter: Which stem separation tool is best?

Our site, Music Demixer (aka <https://freemusicdemixer.com>), is a web-based tool that uses the cutting-edge Demucs AI model to separate music into stems.

In this article, we compare Music Demixer to Spleeter, the AI model developed by Deezer that revolutionized stem separation in 2020.

Spleeter is an AI model, not a consumer website, so it's more fair to compare **Spleeter vs. Demucs**, which is the core AI technology used by our site, Music Demixer.

However, Spleeter has led to many websites and tools that use it, so we will also do a comparison of **Spleeter vs. Music Demixer** to account for all of the web-based versions of Spleeter that exist. Out of all of the Spleeter alternatives, we propose that Music Demixer is a great choice for stem separation.

## Introduction to Spleeter

Spleeter, [developed by Deezer](https://research.deezer.com/projects/spleeter.html), revolutionized AI stem separation in 2020. As an open-source tool, it paved the way for many online services like <span class="blog-highlight">[Moises](https://moises.ai), [Ezstems.com](https://ezstems.com), and [Vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org)</span>. However, as AI technology has advanced, some users have found that Spleeter no longer meets their evolving needs, prompting them to explore newer, more capable tools.

Music Demixer, powered by the cutting-edge <span class="blog-highlight">Demucs AI model</span>, offers superior stem separation with enhanced clarity, fidelity, and ease of use. Let’s dive into why Music Demixer is the best choice for stem separation.

There are multiple Spleeter alternatives, and Demucs is one of the best, which is why we use it as the backbone of our website. We have also developed custom ensemble models and strategies to further improve the quality of our stems. Keep reading to learn more about the differences between Spleeter and Demucs.

## Spleeter’s Limitations

While Spleeter was a game-changer in its time, it now struggles to meet the expectations of modern users. Some key drawbacks include:
- **Quality issues:** In many real-world tests, some users report hearing artifacts or less precise separation, especially in professional-level projects requiring pristine audio quality.
- **Lacking flexibility in stem options:** Can only output fixed configurations of stems (2, 4, or 5), without support for guitar or “other melody.”
- **Limited quality settings:** Only offers a single quality setting, with no customization options.
- **Complex setup:** Requires technical expertise to install and use, especially for offline applications.
- **Websites based on Spleeter:** Many Spleeter-based websites have experienced server issues and extended wait times, making it challenging for users who need consistent results quickly.

## Music Demixer: Powered by Demucs

Music Demixer harnesses the power of **Demucs**, a state-of-the-art AI model designed for high-quality audio separation. Key advantages include:

- **Superior quality:** Demucs excels in separating complex audio, handling overlapping frequencies with precision, and minimizing artifacts.
- **Broader stem support:** Music Demixer supports vocals, bass, drums, piano, melody, and ‘other melody’ (e.g., violin, flute) in arbitrary combinations.
- **Even higher quality settings:** In ensemble configurations, Demucs can generate much higher quality than Spleeter, comparable to the best in the world.
- **Ease of use:** A simple, web-based platform that works on any operating system, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. There’s no installation required or command lines to navigate.
- **Private and secure:** Music Demixer respects user privacy and does not store or share uploaded audio files. All processing is done locally in your browser.

Our website uses the latest trained AI models of Demucs that were improved and updated **as recently as the 2023 Sound Demixing Challenge**, and we are constantly experimenting with improving our algorithms and models.

## Which Tools Use Spleeter?

Several popular tools and websites rely on Spleeter, inheriting its limitations:

- [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai): Offers a user-friendly interface but [uses Spleeter’s legacy technology](https://musically.com/2019/11/22/moises-makes-deezers-spleeter-audio-separation-tool-user-friendly/).
- [Ezstems.com](https://ezstems.com): This service once provided direct access to Spleeter’s functionality. However, users now report it has gone offline and that support inquiries remain unanswered.
- [Vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org): A free tool based on Spleeter, with an inconsistent payment system and limited stem options (no piano).
- [Izotope RX8](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/whats-new-in-rx-8.html): [Previously based on Spleeter](https://literecords.com/showthread.php?68357-iZotope-RX-8-Music-Rebalance), though newer versions use unnamed proprietary models.

## Privacy and Security

If you install Spleeter on your computer, your audio files never leave your computer. However, installing it requires expertise in Python and AI software.

On web-based versions of Spleeter, your audio files are uploaded to a remote server for processing. This can be a privacy concern, especially if you are working with sensitive or unreleased audio.

**Music Demixer** uses a unique design: it’s web-based, but delivers the AI model to your browser and performs the processing locally. Your audio files never leave your computer, ensuring they remain private and secure. Plus, you don’t need any special setup—simply open our site and start demixing. We continuously test and refine it so you always have the latest and greatest version of our software.

## Audio Clips

Don’t just take our word for it. Listen to these audio clips to hear the difference between Spleeter and Demucs for a short clip from *Shimmy Shimmy Ya* by Ol’ Dirty Bastard in 2-stem (vocals/accompaniment or instrumental) separation:

<div class="card-container" id="demo-app">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

You’ll immediately notice the difference in clarity and separation between the two. This is only for a simple 2-stem separation, but the disparity is even more pronounced with more complex instrument stems:
