# Privacy policy

All of our products run privately on your computer through the web browser or on your Android device. Your audio and music files are never uploaded to any server, and there is absolutely no tracking of your activity or usage of the app.

When you pay for a PRO model, you get private and local access to do unlimited demixing on your device!

The interactions with the internet are:
* Managing Stripe payment and billing
* Validating your Stripe billing email to link your valid subscription to your web session
* After successful validation, the AI model is delivered to your browser, where it runs **privately and unlimited,** never contacting our servers again

For any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please [contact us by e-mail](mailto:contact@freemusicdemixer.com).
