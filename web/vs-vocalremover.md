# Music Demixer vs. Vocalremover.org: Which stem separation tool is best?

Our site, **Music Demixer** (aka [freemusicdemixer.com](https://freemusicdemixer.com)), uses the cutting-edge **Demucs** AI model to separate music into stems entirely in your web browser. In this comparison, we‚Äôll look at how Music Demixer stacks up against **Vocalremover.org**. While Vocalremover.org may seem convenient at first glance, user comments reveal issues with IP blocking, partial instrument support, and payment or feature-access roadblocks.

## Introduction to Vocalremover.org

[Vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org) is known for its quick, web-based solution to remove vocals from songs. However, real user feedback points to a few consistent pain points:

1. **Site availability & IP restrictions**
   > ‚ÄúWonderful tool - thank you! But it seems it isn't working today üò≠‚Äù
   > ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt use the splitter feature because it tells me to turn off VPN or proxy. Can someone help me with this one?‚Äù

2. **Limited instrument stems**
   > ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôve been using Splitter for a good long time... Add THE PIANO IN SPLITTER!! I love it... Guitar was added as well, I‚Äôm really happy with that too... but piano is a very big need...‚Äù

These constraints can leave some users searching for a more stable, flexible option. Music Demixer addresses these concerns by delivering robust local processing, advanced AI, and no artificial barriers like IP blocks.
