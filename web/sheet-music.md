## Why Use FreeMusicDemixer for Sheet Music?

- **Automatic Transcription**: No MIDI keyboard? No problem! Upload audio recordings of harmonic instruments or isolate instrument stems, and let our AI generate accurate scores for you.
- **MusicXML Format**: Export sheet music in the widely-supported MusicXML format, compatible with most popular notation software like MuseScore, Finale, or Sibelius.
- **Printable Sheet Music**: Edit, print, or share your sheet music directly from your browser without additional tools.
- **Stem-Specific Scores**: Generate individual scores for vocals, bass, melody, piano, guitar, and more after stem separation.

## How It Works

Using our sheet music feature is simple and streamlined:

1. **Upload Your Track**: Start by uploading a single harmonic instrument recording, or use our stem separation tool to isolate specific parts of your song.
2. **Enable MIDI Transcription**: Check the "MIDI Music Transcription" box during the upload process.
3. **View and Print Sheet Music**: Once the process completes, navigate to the output page to view, print, or save sheet music in MusicXML format.
