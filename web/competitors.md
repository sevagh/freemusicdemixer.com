# Freemusicdemixer vs. Spleeter, Ezstems.com, Vocalremover.org, Izotope, Moises, Lalal.ai

## Freemusicdemixer vs. Competitors

When choosing a tool for stem separation, there are many options and alternatives on the market. Here, we compare Freemusicdemixer.com (or Music Demixer) to some of the most popular alternatives, including <span class="blog-highlight">Spleeter, Moises, Ezstems.com, Izotope RX10, Lalal.ai, and Vocalremover.org</span>. Freemusicdemixer stands out for its advanced AI technology, cross-platform accessibility, and affordability.

## Spleeter

Spleeter: once the industry leader in AI-based stem separation, Spleeter is an open-source AI stem separation model by [Deezer](https://research.deezer.com/projects/spleeter.html) in 2020 has now fallen behind newer technologies. Its audio separation quality often leaves artifacts and lacks the precision required for professional use.

Freemusicdemixer uses <span class="blog-highlight">Demucs</span>, a state-of-the-art AI model that significantly outperforms Spleeter in separating stems with clarity and fidelity. Demucs excels at handling complex audio with overlapping frequencies, delivering results that are suitable for both casual and professional use.

Key advantages of Freemusicdemixer (powered by Demucs) vs. Spleeter:

* Superior quality: clearer separation with fewer artifacts.
* More stems: supports vocals, bass, drums, piano, melody, and 'other melody' (violin, etc.) as separate stems
* Has no complex or vague parameters like frequency cutoff: simply choose your desired stems and quality!
* In ensemble configurations, Demucs can be used to generate much higher qualities than Spleeter, comparable to the best in the world
* Web-based: Works on any OS, including Linux, which is often overlooked by desktop software.

[Here is a discussion on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32360816) about the quality of Demucs compared to Spleeter, where users report that Demucs is hands-down better, even throwing in a comparison to Izotope RX9 as well. This was back in 2022, with the base form of Demucs. Our website offers <span class="blog-highlight">the base model of Demucs for free</span>, while providing custom ensemble models in our paid offering to boost the stem separation quality to new heights.

[Here is a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs/issues/267) where the user compares Demucs to [Lalal.ai](https://lalal.ai/), which is a commercial product with its own custom AI model, and Spleeter, and concludes that <span class="blog-highlight">"after months of testing and hundreds of isolated tracks, I think Demucs is simply the best, in terms of both quality output and fidelity."</span> This is why we are proud to use Demucs as our AI model, and we are confident that it is the best choice for stem separation.

Here is a video describing how Demucs is better than Spleeter, with the comments agreeing:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOVqRfoc0aI?si=MqH58_78HyP-VTxP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>

The comments state that they would pay money for a good GUI for Demucs - we have that! We have a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and understand, and we are always improving it. Unlike other developers, we don't try to package Demucs with all of the complex AI software like Torch. We have custom C++ code that makes it possible to run Demucs in the browser, as fast as possible, on any hardware. <span class="blog-highlight">Our website democtratizes access to Demucs by removing the complexity of Python and AI software, and making it accessible to everyone.</span>

Here's [another forum post](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=576467) talking about how Demucs v3 is mind-blowingly better than Spleeter. That's a generation of Demucs older than what we use!

## Lalal.ai

As mentioned above, Lalal.ai is one of the rare websites <span class="blog-highlight">which does not use the outdated Spleeter</span>. It uses its own custom AI models.

Here is a video where Lalal.ai compares itself to Demucs v3:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mtsPY1R_T8U?si=uplgYNQPwmvaUVP9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>

Our website is powered by <b>Demucs v4</b>, a newer version of the Demucs model, as well as custom ensemble strategies which were developed in the most recent 2023 Sound Demixing Challenge for our higher-quality stems.

Although we cannot do a full comparison with Lalal.ai, we are confident that our stem separation based on Demucs v4 will perform with near-state-of-the-art results.

## Moises

[Moises](https://moises.ai/) is a musical app and website which contains a stem separation component [powered by Spleeter](), inheriting its limitations. While it offers a user-friendly interface, the underlying technology does not match the quality of Demucs.

Why choose Freemusicdemixer over Moises?
* Transparent pricing with no reliance on outdated AI models.
* More stems and quality options, and a 100% focus on stem separation.
* No usage limits or restrictions.

## Ezstems.com

Ezstems.com is powered by the same Spleeter model but has recently become completely unresponsive. Even paid users report that the service is offline, with customer support failing to respond.

While it was active, it simply offered a web interface to Spleeter, with no added value or improvements.

Freemusicdemixer offers a more reliable and user-friendly alternative, and adds a lot of value on top of Demucs, including custom ensemble models for world-beating drum and bass separation qualities, and additional features like MIDI conversion and automatic music transcription.

Why choose Freemusicdemixer.com over Ezstems.com?
* Fully operational with 100% uptime.
* Reliable customer support.
* Superior stem separation powered by Demucs.
* More quality and stem options.
* Additional features like MIDI conversion and automatic music transcription.

Freemusicdemixer.com was created by somebody that understands servers and server costs very well. There is little risk of our website going offline because we don't need a certain level of profitability. Local processing is king! Take back control of your music processing and don't rely on a third party to be up and running.

## Izotope RX10

Izotope RX10 is a professional-grade audio editing suite with stem separation capabilities. While powerful, it comes with significant drawbacks:
* Price: At $1,000+ for a one-time license, itâ€™s prohibitively expensive for many users.
* Platform Limitations: Available only on Windows and macOS.

Freemusicdemixer offers a more accessible alternative:
* Affordable: $50 CAD per year.
* Cross-platform: Works seamlessly on any OS via the web.
* Customer-Approved: Multiple users have switched from Izotope to Freemusicdemixer for its ease of use and comparable quality.
* Pure focus on stem separation: Izotope RX softwares are general-purpose audio editing suite, while Freemusicdemixer is focused on stem separation.

Izotope RX8 was at a time based on Spleeter, again inheriting its limitations. Newer versions of Izotope software use unknown, unnamed models. We proudly use Demucs and never hide it.

Although we can't share it, <span class="blog-highlight">we have received e-mails from multiple customers that prefer the audio quality of our product to Izotope RX.</span> Join them today!

## Vocalremover.org

[Vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org) is a web-based stem separation tool like ours, with mixed reviews. Recent customer feedback highlights issues:
* Frequent failures in stem separation.
* Limited stem support (e.g., no piano stems).
* Payment not working to unlock subscriber features

Freemusicdemixer addresses these gaps by:
* Delivering consistent, high-quality results.
* Offering support for a wide range of stems, including piano and melody.
* Responsive customer support and a robust, working web platform

Just like Ezstems.com, Vocalremover.org stands the risk of going offline at any time, and is already cracking at the seams. Freemusicdemixer is built to be reliable and always available. Vocalremover.org is based on Spleeter. Again, not something they are transparent about!
