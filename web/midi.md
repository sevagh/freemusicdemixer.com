# MIDI Converter

Imagine playing a guitar lick, converting it into MIDI, and transforming it into a piano melody with your favorite MIDI software. With our MIDI conversion tool, that’s not just possible—it’s effortless.

## What is MIDI?

**MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)** is a powerful standard that represents musical notes, timing, and dynamics digitally. Unlike audio files, which store sound directly, MIDI files store instructions for how music is played, making them incredibly versatile for:
- **Editing**: Change notes, timing, or instruments with ease.
- **Arranging**: Swap an instrument track (e.g., guitar) with another (e.g., piano).
- **Composition**: Create new music using existing MIDI patterns or convert recordings to MIDI for further creativity.

Our tool allows you to generate **precise MIDI files** from audio recordings, saving hours of manual transcription.

## MIDI Conversion + Stem Separation: A Perfect Match

MIDI conversion works hand-in-hand with our stem separation tool:
- **Split tracks into stems**: Isolate instruments like guitar, piano, or vocals.
- **Convert stems to MIDI**: Turn harmonic instruments into editable MIDI files.
- **Combine and Remix**: Use the MIDI output to reimagine your track with different instruments or arrangements.

For single-instrument recordings, you can skip the stem separation step entirely and directly convert audio to MIDI for maximum efficiency.

## Use Your Instrument as a MIDI Controller

Don’t own a MIDI keyboard or controller? No problem! Our tool lets you use **any instrument** as a MIDI input:
1. **Record a Performance**: Play your melody or chord progression on your guitar, piano, or any other instrument.
2. **Convert to MIDI**: Upload the recording to our tool and generate a MIDI file.
3. **Transform the Sound**: Import the MIDI file into your favorite software and assign it to a virtual instrument—swap your guitar lick for a piano, violin, or even a synth.

This process is perfect for musicians who want to experiment with different sounds without needing expensive MIDI equipment.

## FAQs

### Can I use MIDI conversion without stem separation?
Absolutely! If you have a single instrument recording, you can directly upload it for MIDI conversion. This saves time and simplifies the process.

### Does the tool work for complex polyphonic music?
Yes, but it works best with harmonic instruments like piano or guitar. For highly complex tracks, we recommend using stem separation first.
