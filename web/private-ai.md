# Unleash Unrestricted Music Creation — Private, Offline, and Empowering

Are you frustrated with the limitations imposed by cloud-based music tools and <span class="blog-highlight">restrictive industry practices both by AI companies and record labels</span>? It's time to experience true freedom and privacy with our offline music source separation software that runs directly in your browser — no uploads, no limitations, just pure creative control.

## The Struggle with the Music and AI Industries

### Record Labels Often Don't Respect Artists

For decades, artists have faced unfair treatment from record labels, often losing control over their own creations due to complex contracts. High-profile disputes, such as [Taylor Swift's battle over her master recordings](https://studentvanguardintl.org/taylor-swifts-master-recordings-battle-a-case-study-in-artist-ownership-and-power/), highlight how artists can be deprived of rights to their own music.

### Ethical Concerns with AI Companies Training Data

Many companies train their AI models using copyrighted material without proper licensing, raising legal and ethical questions. The MIT Technology Review realizes that this is such a big ethical issue that they are providing artists [with guidelines on how to prevent AI companies from using their art without permission](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/21/1107108/four-ways-to-protect-your-art-from-ai/).

Additionally, there's a lack of transparency regarding how user data is utilized. According to VentureBeat, [ethical dilemmas arise when AI models are trained on user inputs without explicit consent, potentially infringing on users' intellectual property rights](https://venturebeat.com/games/how-ai-is-making-copyright-issues-more-complicated-devcom-panel/).

Legal challenges are emerging in this space, with lawsuits highlighting the misuse of data in AI training. [This article by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/02/musicians-demand-protection-against-ai) shows that <span class="blog-highlight">major artists and musicians like Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj, Stevie Wonder, and others are demanding protection against AI-generated music that infringes on their copyrights</span>.

### Risks of Cloud-Based Music Separation Tools

Cloud SaaS music separation services often limit users due to agreements with record labels and regional copyright laws. Users who pay for these services might find themselves unable to process certain tracks because of arbitrary restrictions.

Moreover, uploading your personal audio files to the cloud raises significant privacy concerns. [Data breaches are an ever-present risk](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/) as highlighted by TechCrunch, potentially exposing your files to unauthorized access.
